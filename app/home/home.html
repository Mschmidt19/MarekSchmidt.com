                    <p id="homeText">Hello, my name is Marek Schmidt. I am a 21 year old Front End Web Developer and Graphic Designer living in Irvine,
                        California. With a background in Computer Engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara, as well as
                        self-practice with the MEAN stack, I was finally able to pinpoint the area I am most passionate about - design.
                        Combining my love for development with my love for UI/UX and design in the form of front end web development
                        has resonated perfectly with my adorations. Since finding my true calling, my only goal has been to enhance my skills
                        and become a master of my craft. This site is meant to both document and showcase myself, my improvements, and the
                        projects that have guided me through the journey.

            <br/><br/>
            All my life I have had a great passion for technology. Growing up in a time where computers and devices are improving exponentially, there has always been something new or improved to marvel at - and there lies my motivation. Seeing all this action unfold before my eyes ignited the spark which has now turned into the fire which drives me today. In fact, when I was a wee little lad I would tell everyone that when I grew up, I wanted to be an “inventor”, with dreams of being a not-so-mad scientist inventing gadgets in a super high-tech lab. Once I matured a bit and realized how broad of a goal that truly was, I had to narrow down my dream to a more realistic specialization. I have always loved art and making something look beautiful, but that wasn’t exactly what I wanted. Thus I landed on computers. In my teens, I dabbled in all sorts of computer-related material: I convinced my mom to let me take summer game design classes while still in middle school, I created banner and signature images for people on forums just for fun, I built my first desktop at the age of fourteen, I became a board member of my first user group at age sixteen, and of a second at seventeen, and finally at eighteen, I was admitted to Honors Engineering in the field of Computer Engineering at University of California, Santa Barbara. Unfortunately, at this point things took a turn for the worse. I experienced a tremendous medical scare nearing the end of my freshman year, having to undergo emergency surgery and pending a diagnosis of lymphoma. In the end, this did turn out to be only a “scare”, however my health was compromised from the surgery, requiring absences which I could not recover from academically in such a rigorous program. I departed the university in 2014 and promptly embarked on some more soul-searching. Luckily, along with an immense amount of knowledge, my brief years at the university did give me the guidance and experience to help me determine that hardware was not where I belonged, but programming is what truly kept me going. I enrolled in a Full Stack Bootcamp called School of Devs and immediately found what I was searching for in the form of front-end web design. With this perfect synergy of development and design, I have finally found my calling. After all, it fits perfectly with what I’ve always wanted to do – create something amazing and visually stunning.

                <p>My first project ever attempted. It was done in class so it is not 100% polished, as we were on a
                    time constraint. The point of this project was to simulate the card game "War". In War, the deck is
                    split evenly between two players, then each player flips over their top card. Whichever player has the higher
                    card collects both cards and adds them to the bottom of his/her deck (in this case ace is 1, or the lowest card).
                    in the case of a tie (or a "war"), three cards are placed face down and the fourth is flipped, playing with the
                    same rules as usual, with the winner recieving all eight cards. </p>

                <iframe class="portfolioIFrame" scrolling="no" src="http://www.sanger.dk/"></iframe>
                <p>This was another project done in class, so again, it is not 100% polished. As I began to learn Angular as well as some
                    beginning back end, I decided to test my skills by imitating an online game shop. The information for each of the
                games is stored in Firebase and is being dynamically displayed through three-way data binding and ng-repeats. Unfortunately,
                I tried to use one partial for all individual game pages which caused a problem with loading data when the left hand menu is not used.
                In addition, I had not reached user authentication yet, so I made a dummy log in to simulate what the real one would look like. If a real
                authentication had been implemented in time the issue with the cart emptying would also have been cleared </p>
